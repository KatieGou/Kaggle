Tried three different classification methods: XGBoosting, GradientBoosting and Randomforest. Achieved best accuracy 0.78229 on test data. 

Some gain: 
Some features are irrelevant and should be discarded. Plotting can show the relations well. 
df.isnull().sum() can show the NAN values in a dataframe.
